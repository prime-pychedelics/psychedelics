***4-ACO-DMT***

4-Acetoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (also known as <b>4-AcO-DMT, 4-Acetoxy-DMT, O-Acetylpsilocin, and psilocin) is a novel psychedelic substance of the tryptamine class. 4-AcO-DMT is chemically similar to psilocybin, the active ingredient in psilocybin mushrooms (magic mushrooms). It belongs to a group known as the substituted tryptamines which act by stimulating serotonin receptorsin the brain.

Buy 4-ACO DMT Online, O-Acetylpsilocin is a synthetically produced psychoactive drug and has been suggested by David Nichols to be a potentially useful alternative to psilocybin for pharmacological studies, as they are both believed to be prodrugs of psilocin.

4-ACO DMT Online and several other esters of psilocin were originally patented on January 16, 1963, by Sandoz Ltd. via Albert Hofmann &amp; Franz Troxler. Despite this fact, 4-AcO-DMT remains a psychedelic with a limited history of use prior to its release as a grey area compound on the online research chemical market. There are, however, claims of subjective differences in effect between the acetylated and non-acetylated forms of psilocin.[4] Some users report that it lasts slightly longer than psilocin while others report that it lasts for a considerably shorter time. Many users report less body load and nausea compared to psilocin. Some users find that the visual distortions produce more closely resemble those produced by DMT than those produced by psilocin. These differences could be possible if 4-AcO-DMT is active itself and not merely as a prodrug.

It is a naturally occurring substance, found in various plants and animals, and in small quantities in the human brain, where its function is unknown. It is famous for its power. Though the psychedelic trip it creates only lasts 5 to 30 minutes when smoked, the effect is profound and remarkable, with the feeling that the user is transported to a completely different place, immersed in kaleidoscopic sounds and images.

Dimethyltryptamine is a powerful hallucinogen, meant to be carefully administered in a calm environment to someone who has prior experience with other psychedelic drugs.The drug is relatively rare due to the lack of commercial demand and the scarcity of people with the knowledge and motivation to isolate it from plants. Still, as a molecule, it seems like a terrain ripe for discovery.

##-----KETAMINE-------######

***Ketamine***

Ketamine (Ketalar) Powder produces an abrupt high that lasts for about an hour. It starts around 2 to 5 minutes after the dose has been smoked or swallowed. With injection, it happens around 30 seconds after the injection has occurred.
The first feeling of the high the user will get is an overwhelming feeling of relaxation, sometimes described as a full-body buzz. Some users feel like they’re floating and some even describe it as being out of their bodies. Many experience hallucinations that can last longer than the anesthetic effects.

Higher doses can produce more intense effects, with users reporting complete and utter detachment from their bodies. The effects are similar to those described by people who have had near-death experiences, and it’s described as being in the “K-hole”. Ketamine (Ketalar) Powder does, of course, have side effects, and these can be quite profound. Short-term side effects include bad hallucinations. As with all psychotropic drugs, the pleasantness  of the hallucination depends on the user’s state of mind, and if the user is seeking to escape unhappiness, the hallucinations are likely to be unpleasant. Ketamine (Ketalar) Powder

Large doses of Ketamine (Ketalar) Powder can result in what some describe as the “K-hole,” which can include intense and unpleasant visual and auditory hallucinations coupled with marked derealization and a frightening detachment from reality.
Perhaps more acutely problematic,Ketamine (Ketalar) Powder users can also become quite nauseated. If this progresses to vomiting, it can be very dangerous, as those in the midst of state of dissociated confusion frequently end up supine—presenting a serious choking hazard. If you do see someone on Ketamine (Ketalar) Powder, take a moment to roll them on their side or into the recovery position if possible to prevent this from happening. Promptly call 911 to get emergency medical assistance.

Also, according to the DEA, a major U.S. source of illicit ketamine arrives across the border from Mexico. Also widespread ketamine abuse began in the late 1970s as subcultures (e.g., mind explorers, new agers, spiritualists) experimented with the drug. Ketamine may be injected intravenously or intramuscularly, used intranasally (“snorted”), consumed orally, or added to marijuana and smoked. In social situations, illicit ketamine is most frequently used orally or intranasally.

Doses of 1 to 2 milligram per kilogram of body weight produce intense hallucinogenic and dissociative effects for roughly one hour. Sensations may include floating, stimulation and visual effects. Larger doses may result in the “k-hole”, where users are near full sedation and are said to mimic an “out-of-body” or “near-death” experience. High doses may dangerously reduce breathing, lead to muscles spasms or weakness, dizziness, balance difficulty, impaired vision, slurred speech, nausea and vomiting, and severe confusion.Buy Ketamine HCL Liquid Online | buy ketamine online usa. buy cheap ketamine online , how to buy ketamine online , buy ketamine online usa, buy online ketamine ,buy ketamine hcl online , buy ketamine online no prescription , online ketamine buying , Buy Ketamine Online , Ketamine for sale , buy legal ketamine online , buy liquid ketamine online Buy Ketamine Liquid Online.
